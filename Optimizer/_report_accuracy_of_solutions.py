	TODO: The outcome of the optimization is a leak info
	consisting of e.g., {'xL': [100, 200, 300],
						'CdAl': [0.5, 0.4, 0.1] }
	The ultimate purpose of this function is to compare the predictions
	of ML models and optimization models
	So, first, the optimization results need to be converted to sections
	Then, the results of each section need to be treated as a classification.
